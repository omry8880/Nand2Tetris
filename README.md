Folders 1–5 represent the low-level aspect of this project. 
They primarily include HDL (Hardware Description Language) files that implement the logic gates and core hardware components, such as the ALU, CPU, and memory units. 
Folders 6–10 represent the high-level aspect, where we used Java to develop the virtual machine translator, the compiler, and other components of the software stack that translate high-level code into machine-executable instructions.
